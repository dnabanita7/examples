# Spam Classification with mlpack on the command line

## Introduction

: <<'COMMENT'
In this tutorial, the mlpack command line interface will
be used to train a machine learning model to classify
SMS spam. It will be assumed that mlpack has been
successfully installed on your machine. The tutorial has
been tested in a linux environment. It is written in
bash - https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/

Download the dataset using the `download_data_set.py` python script in the 
tools directory.

Then run this example script using

  bash spam_classification.sh

If you are using a low power computer, you may want to run 
the script using

  nice -20 bash spam_classification.sh

so that it runs as a background task.

## Example

: <<'COMMENT'
As an example, we will train a machine learning model to classify 
spam SMS messages. We will use an example spam dataset in Indonesian 
provided by Yudi Wibisono.

We will try to classify a message as spam or ham by the number of
occurences of a word in a message. We first change the file line
endings, merge lines 243 and 244 which should not be separated
and then remove the header from the dataset. We then remove any
blank lines and split our data into two files, labels and messages.
Since the labels are at the end of the message, the message is
reversed and then the labels are placed in one file. The messages
are then placed in another file.
COMMENT

tr '\r' '\n' < ../data/dataset_sms_spam_bhs_indonesia_v1/dataset_sms_spam_v1.csv > dataset.txt
sed '485{N;s/\n//;}' dataset.txt > dataset1.csv
sed '1d' dataset1.csv > dataset2.csv
sed '/^$/d' dataset2.csv > dataset.csv
rev dataset.csv | cut -c1  | rev > labels.txt
rev dataset.csv | cut -c2- | rev > messages.txt
rm dataset.csv
rm dataset1.csv
rm dataset2.csv
rm dataset.txt

: <<'COMMENT'
Machine learning works on numeric data, so we will use labels of 
1 for ham and 0 for spam. The dataset contains three labels, 0, 
normal sms (ham), 1, fraud (spam) and 2, promotion (spam). We will 
label all spam as 1, so promotions and fraud will be labelled as 1.
COMMENT

tr '2' '1' < labels.txt > labels.csv
rm labels.txt

: <<'COMMENT'
The next step is to convert all text in the messages to lower case 
and for simplicity remove punctuation and any symbols that are not 
spaces, line endings or in the range a-z (one would need expand 
this range of symbols for production use) 
COMMENT

tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < messages.txt > messagesLower.txt
tr -Cd 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \n' < messagesLower.txt > messagesLetters.txt
rm messagesLower.txt

: <<'COMMENT'
We now obtain a sorted list of unique words used (this step may take 
a few minutes).
COMMENT

xargs -n1 < messagesLetters.txt > temp.txt
sort temp.txt > temp2.txt
uniq temp2.txt > words.txt
rm temp.txt
rm temp2.txt

: <<'COMMENT'
We then create a matrix, where for each message, the frequency of word 
occurrences is counted (more on this on Wikipedia, 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tfâ€“idf and 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix ).

: <<'COMMENT'
This gives approximately 90% validation rate, similar to that 
obtained at 
https://towardsdatascience.com/spam-detection-with-logistic-regression-23e3709e522

The dataset is composed of approximately 50% spam messages, 
so the validation rates are quite good without doing much parameter tuning.
In typical cases, datasets are unbalanced with many more entries in 
some categories than in others. In these cases a good validation
rate can be obtained by mispredicting the class with a few entries. 
Thus to better evaluate these models, one can compare the number of 
misclassifications of spam, and the number of misclassifications of ham. 
Of particular importance in applications is the number of false 
positive spam results as these are typically not transmitted. The next 
portion of the script creates a confusion matrix.

You should get output similar to

 Logistic Regression
 Total spam 183
 Total ham 159
 Confusion matrix
                  Predicted  class
                -------------------
                 |  Ham     | Spam
 | Actual | Ham  |  128     | 26
 | class  | Spam |  31      | 157

which indicates a reasonable level of classification.
Other methods you can try in mlpack for this problem include:
* Naive Bayes
https://mlpack.org/doc/stable/cli_documentation.html#nbc
* Random forest
https://mlpack.org/doc/stable/cli_documentation.html#random_forest
* Decision tree
https://mlpack.org/doc/stable/cli_documentation.html#decision_tree
* AdaBoost
https://mlpack.org/doc/stable/cli_documentation.html#adaboost
* Perceptron
https://mlpack.org/doc/stable/cli_documentation.html#perceptron

To improve the error rating, you can try other pre-processing methods 
on the initial data set.  Neural networks can give up to 99.95% 
validation rates, see for example:

https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume11No1/Paper_67-The_Impact_of_Deep_Learning_Techniques.pdf 
https://www.kaggle.com/kredy10/simple-lstm-for-text-classification
https://www.kaggle.com/xiu0714/sms-spam-detection-bert-acc-0-993

However, using these techniques with mlpack is best covered in another tutorial.
