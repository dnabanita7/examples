# Spam Classification with mlpack on the command line

## Introduction

In this tutorial, the mlpack command line interface will
be used to train a machine learning model to classify
SMS spam. It will be assumed that mlpack has been
successfully installed on your machine. The tutorial has
been tested in a linux environment.

## Example

As an example, we will train some machine learning models to classify spam SMS messages. We will use an example spam dataset in Indonesian provided by Yudi Wibisono.

We will try to classify a message as spam or ham by the number of occurences of a word in a message. We first change the file line endings, remove line 243 which is missing a label and then remove the header from the dataset. Then, we split our data into two files, labels and messages. Since the labels are at the end of the message, the message is reversed and then the label removed and placed in one file. The message is then removed and placed in another file.

```
tr '\r' '\n' < dataset_sms_spam_v1.csv > dataset.txt
sed '243d' dataset.txt > dataset1.csv
sed '1d' dataset1.csv > dataset.csv
rev dataset.csv | cut -c1  | rev > labels.txt
rev dataset.csv | cut -c2- | rev > messages.txt
rm dataset.csv
rm dataset1.csv
rm dataset.txt
```

Machine learning works on numeric data, so we will use labels to 1 for ham and 0 for spam. The dataset contains three labels, 0, normal sms (ham), 1, fraud (spam) and 2, promotion (spam). We will label all spam as 1, so promotions
and fraud will be labelled as 1.


```
tr '2' '1' < labels.txt > labels.csv
rm labels.txt
```

The next step is to convert all text in the messages to lower case and for simplicity remove punctuation and any symbols that are not spaces, line endings or in the range a-z (one would need expand this range of symbols for production use) 

```
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < messages.txt > messagesLower.txt
tr -Cd 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \n' < messagesLower.txt > messagesLetters.txt
rm messagesLower.txt
```

We now obtain a sorted list of unique words used (this step may take a few minutes, so use nice to give it a low priority while you continue with other tasks on your computer).

```
nice -20 xargs -n1 < messagesLetters.txt > temp.txt
sort temp.txt > temp2.txt
uniq temp2.txt > words.txt
rm temp.txt
rm temp2.txt
```

We then create a matrix, where for each message, the frequency of word occurrences is counted (more on this on Wikipedia, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tfâ€“idf) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix)). This requires a few lines of code, so the full script, which should be saved as 'makematrix.sh' is below:

```
#!/bin/bash
declare -a words=()
declare -a letterstartind=()
declare -a letterstart=()
letter=" "
i=0
lettercount=0
while IFS= read -r line; do
        labels[$((i))]=$line
        let "i++"
done < labels.csv
i=0
while IFS= read -r line; do
        words[$((i))]=$line
        firstletter="$( echo $line | head -c 1 )"
        if [ "$firstletter" != "$letter" ]
        then
                letterstartind[$((lettercount))]=$((i))
                letterstart[$((lettercount))]=$firstletter
                letter=$firstletter
                let "lettercount++"
        fi
        let "i++"
done < words.txt
letterstartind[$((lettercount))]=$((i))
echo "Created list of letters"

touch wordfrequency.txt
rm wordfrequency.txt
touch wordfrequency.txt
messagecount=0
messagenum=0
messages="$( wc -l messages.txt )"
i=0
while IFS= read -r line; do
        let "messagenum++"
        declare -a wordcount=()
        declare -a wordarray=()
        read -r -a wordarray <<< "$line"
        let "messagecount++"
        words=${#wordarray[@]}
        for word in "${wordarray[@]}"; do
                startletter="$( echo $word | head -c 1 )"
                j=-1
                while [ $((j)) -lt $((lettercount)) ]; do
                        let "j++"
                        if [ "$startletter" == "${letterstart[$((j))]}" ]
                        then
                                mystart=$((j))
                        fi
                done
                myend=$((mystart))+1
                j=${letterstartind[$((mystart))]}
                jend=${letterstartind[$((myend))]}
                while [ $((j)) -le $((jend)) ]; do
                        wordcount[$((j))]=0
                        if [ "$word" == "${words[$((j))]}" ]
                        then
                                wordcount[$((j))]="$( echo $line | grep -o $word | wc -l )"
                        fi
                        let "j++"
                done
        done
        for j in "${!wordcount[@]}"; do
                wordcount[$((j))]=$(echo " scale=4; $((${wordcount[$((j))]})) / $((words))" | bc)
        done
        wordcount[$((words))+1]=$((words))
        echo "${wordcount[*]}" >> wordfrequency.txt
        echo "Processed message ""$messagenum"
        let "i++"
done < messagesLetters.txt
# Create csv file
tr ' '  ',' < wordfrequency.txt > data.csv
```

Since [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is an interpreted language, this simple implementation can take up to 30 minutes to complete. If using the above Bash script on your primary workstation, run it as a task with low priority so that you can continue with other work while you wait:

```
nice -20 bash makematrix.sh
```

Once the script has finished running, split the data into testing (30%) and training (70%) sets:

```
mlpack_preprocess_split                        \
    --input_file data.csv                      \
    --input_labels_file labels.csv             \
    --training_file train.data.csv             \
    --training_labels_file train.labels.csv    \
    --test_file test.data.csv                  \
    --test_labels_file test.labels.csv         \
    --test_ratio 0.3                           \
    --verbose
```

Now train a [Logistic regression model](https://mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.1/cli_documentation.html#logistic_regression):

```
mlpack_logistic_regression --training_file train.data.csv    \
                           --labels_file train.labels.csv    \
                           --lambda 0.1                      \
                           --output_model_file lr_model.bin
```

Finally we test our model by producing predictions,

```
mlpack_logistic_regression --input_model_file lr_model.bin    \
                           --test_file test.data.csv          \
                           --output_file lr_predictions.csv
```

and comparing the predictions with the exact results,

```
export incorrect=$(diff -U 0 lr_predictions.csv test.labels.csv | grep '^@@' | wc -l)
export tests=$(wc -l < lr_predictions.csv)
echo "scale=2;  100 * ( 1 - $((incorrect)) / $((tests)))"  | bc
```

This gives approximately 90% validation rate, similar to that obtained [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/spam-detection-with-logistic-regression-23e3709e522).

The dataset is composed of approximately 50% spam messages, so the validation rates are quite good without doing much parameter tuning.
In typical cases, datasets are unbalanced with many more entries in some categories than in others. In these cases a good validation
rate can be obtained by mispredicting the class with a few entries. 
Thus to better evaluate these models, one can compare the number of misclassifications of spam, and the number of misclassifications of ham. 
Of particular importance in applications is the number of false positive spam results as these are typically not transmitted. The script below produces a confusion matrix which gives a better indication of misclassification.
Save it as 'confusion.sh'

```
#!/bin/bash
declare -a labels
declare -a lr
i=0
while IFS= read -r line; do
        labels[i]=$line
        let "i++"
done < test.labels.csv
i=0
while IFS= read -r line; do
        lr[i]=$line
        let "i++"
done < lr_predictions.csv
TruePositiveLR=0
FalsePositiveLR=0
TrueZerpLR=0
FalseZeroLR=0
Positive=0
Zero=0
for i in "${!labels[@]}"; do
        if [ "${labels[$i]}" == "1" ]
        then
                let "Positive++"
                if [ "${lr[$i]}" == "1" ] 
                then
                        let "TruePositiveLR++"
                else
                        let "FalseZeroLR++"
                fi
        fi
        if [ "${labels[$i]}" == "0" ]
        then
                let "Zero++"
                if [ "${lr[$i]}" == "0" ]
                then
                        let "TrueZeroLR++"
                else
                        let "FalsePositiveLR++"
                fi
        fi

done
echo "Logistic Regression"
echo "Total spam"  $Positive
echo "Total ham"  $Zero
echo "Confusion matrix"
echo "             Predicted class"
echo "                 Ham | Spam "
echo "              ---------------"
echo " Actual| Ham  | " $TrueZeroLR "|" $FalseZeroLR
echo " class | Spam | " $FalsePositiveLR " |" $TruePositiveLR
echo ""

```

then run the script

```
bash confusion.sh
```

You should get output similar to

> Logistic Regression<br>
> Total spam 183<br>
> Total ham 159<br>
> Confusion matrix<br>
> |           |          |Predicted |class
> |  ---      |---       |    ---   |---
> |           |          | **Ham**  | **Spam** 
> | **Actual**| **Ham**  |  128     | 26
> | **class** | **Spam** |  31      | 157

which indicates a reasonable level of classification.
Other methods you can try in mlpack for this problem include:
* [Naive Bayes](https://mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.1/cli_documentation.html#nbc)
* [Random forest](https://mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.1/cli_documentation.html#random_forest) 
* [Decision tree](https://mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.1/cli_documentation.html#decision_tree)
* [AdaBoost](https://mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.1/cli_documentation.html#adaboost)
* [Perceptron](https://mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.1/cli_documentation.html#perceptron)

To improve the error rating, you can try other pre-processing methods on the initial data set.
Neural networks can give up to 99.95% validation rates, see for example [here](https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume11No1/Paper_67-The_Impact_of_Deep_Learning_Techniques.pdf), [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kredy10/simple-lstm-for-text-classification) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/xiu0714/sms-spam-detection-bert-acc-0-993). However, using these techniques with mlpack is best covered in another tutorial.

This tutorial is an adaptation of one that first appeared in the [Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/spam-classification-with-ml-pack/).
